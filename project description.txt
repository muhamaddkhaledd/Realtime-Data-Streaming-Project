Realtime Data Streaming Project

A fully containerized end-to-end data engineering pipeline built with Airflow, Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark, Cassandra, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
The pipeline fetches data from the randomuser.me API using Apache Airflow, streams it in real time through Kafka, processes it with Apache Spark, and stores the results in Cassandra.
This project demonstrates real-time data ingestion, processing, and storage with automated orchestration and scalable architecture.
